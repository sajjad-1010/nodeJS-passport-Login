# nodeJS-passport-Login
this single and simple login page is my first project with nodeJS , i hope it's wrok for you and help you too 

## How to run

<p>to run this project do this steps:</p>

1. open the cmd in yor file destination and type "npm i --save-dev nodemon dotenv" nodemon is an library for restarting and updating the server every time we save the code and project 

2. the next library you most install is bcrypt with 'npm i bcrypt' for encrypt and decrypting the password that user send in

3.the next thing you might install is passsport,passport-local,express-session and express-flash with this cmd command 'npm i passsport passport-local express-session express-flash'

4. and with all of that you can run the 'npm run devStart' in you'r cmd and run the local server on 3000 port 'localhost:3000/'

5. now try my first login page and enjoy :D
